{: .intro-block}
I'm a student-athlete and aspiring IT professional with roots in Australia and current base in Louisville. Iâ€™m wrapping up my degree in Computer Information Systems at the University of Louisville, while continuing my soccer career in the NCAA and USL2. Off the field, I'm all about building things â€” especially digital ones â€” that make life smoother, smarter, or just more fun.


## ðŸŽ¯ Career Goals
{:.about-header}

My goal is to merge my competitive mindset with tech. Iâ€™m working toward a career in software and system development, with interests in cybersecurity, data analysis, and web technologies. Long-term, I want to be part of a team building smart, scalable systems that make a real impact â€” whether thatâ€™s in sports tech, analytics, or something completely unexpected.
